## United States Quality of Life Index, 2021
###The Metrics
The EASI Quality of Life Index is calculated from the following data metrics for each state: population density, population demograpic characteristics (sex, race, age), housing units by tenure, median household income, population in poverty, total population, and total households. Each state is given a QOL scoring, with the US average at 100. 


### Recommended for 
This map would be useful for assessing the QOL of a current state of residence or helping to determine a new state of residence. This map would also be helpful for geographers, health professionals, or economists to determine nation-wide trends in QOL and examine any regional commonalities. 

### Functions
Feature functions include a visually appealing diverging color pallet of 5 classes to represent state QOL scores from least to greatest with a hover feature that shows the QOL index number for each state. A user may also zoom to state "on click" or by using mouse zoom feature, or use mouse to drag and navigate to desired geographic location. The map contains a legible legend with QOL ranges and their corresponding color association. 


### Data Sources
United States geoJson file was used for US State boundaries. Cartocdn Light_all basemap was applied from Leaflet Providers. EASI Quality of Life Index data was generated through Social Explorer. Diverging 5-class color scale was applied from ColorBrewer.
